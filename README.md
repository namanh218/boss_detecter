# boss_detecter
I have small feature in my project using opencv2 and pretrained model Facenet, and using SVM to predict.  I capture my face and Minh Anh's face for 300 pics by opencv, and trained them in face_net model from Google, after that using SVM predict my face and Minh Anh's face. Opencv find out the face if it's Minh Anh's face it's trigger a code.
